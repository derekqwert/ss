Subject: Request for Notice Period Buyout

Dear Pallavi,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to formally request the option to buy out my notice period. I resigned from my position on 22nd July and have since ensured that there are no pending dependencies from my end.

Given that my responsibilities are transitioned and there are no outstanding tasks, I kindly request your approval to proceed with the buyout of my remaining notice period. This will help me in making a smooth transition, and I am ready to complete any required formalities as per company policy.

Please let me know the next steps or if any further information is required from my side.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Best regards,
Sagnik Ghosh
