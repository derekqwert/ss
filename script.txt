Got an external offer which wants early release (30 days)
Fits what I really want to do as a developer
I don’t have any dependency now
I don't want to lose this opportunity
Will be very good for my career
Project allocation is ending on 31 July (10 days) + having 1 months of earned leaves

Have always wanted to be a good developer
Support just isn’t my thing, and I feel like I’ve stopped learning and growing in this role.

Getting very hard for me now day by day
only son, getting many responsibilities
Getting very less with 2 YOE, very hard to survive in BLR
can not go home also, neither can buy anything, EMIs
Can not send any money to home and can not do anything for mom-dad

I totally get there are rules around this, and I appreciate everything you’ve done for me.
Will be very kind of you if you can help me


"Hi [Manager’s Name], do you have some time to discuss something important regarding my role?"

"My current project allocation ends on 31 July, and I don’t have any pending dependencies with the team."

"To be completely honest, there are also some personal responsibilities and financial pressures—for example, I’m the only son supporting my family, and it’s becoming quite challenging in Bangalore on my current salary."

"I’d truly appreciate your support in considering an early release. It would be extremely helpful for my future, as well as for my family."

All my life, I’ve wanted to grow into a really good developer. I feel desperate because support roles are holding me back
